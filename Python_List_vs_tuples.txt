=> Difference between tuple and list in python
- List can be modified(mutable) and tuple can not(Immutable) and both are sequential data types

=> Sequential data types:

	- There are total 7 sequential data types in python
		-string
		-Unicode string
		-list
		-tuple
		-bytearrays
		-buffer
		-xrange
	-Dictionary and sets are containers for sequential data
	
=>The Difference Between a Variable and an Object
	- Variable is a reference to the python object in thr memory
	- For, Example
		a=["apple","banana"]
		- When you do this, a python object of type list is created in the memory and the variable 
		  'a' refers to this object by holding its location in memory.
		-In fact, you can actually retrieve the location of the list object in memory by inspecting a using the id() function.
		
=> Multiple appending to a string object is inefficient because string object is Immutable. 
	- Immutable objects take more time for appending than the mutable

=> When you type b=a you are just copying address of the object refered by a.

=> Immutable objects are easy for the debugging as they are not modified.

=> Immutable object are memory efficient as python compiler will bundle the different objects into one with the same value.
	- For Example,
		a = "Vraj"
		b = "Vraj"
		
		- Python compilerwill bundle these 2 different variable into same object
		- This thing is possible and safe because string are immutable and same with int, float, boolean
